The main python script in this process is commented, so you can follow the logic behind the task asked.
It is VERY important to note that for this script to work you will have to create the necessary tables in a schema of your own, the schema I used here is a local one.
The sql script can create the tables, but the schema should be created in the dbms (in this case i used mysql)
Also, once this is done, the connection parameters in the functions of the python script should be updated with the ones related to your own schema.
